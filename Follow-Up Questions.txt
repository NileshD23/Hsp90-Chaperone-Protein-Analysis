(1) Are there differences in the fraction of charged amino acids in 
the linker region relative to the rest of the protein? What are they?

	According to my data, the fraction of positively charged amino acids
	in the disordered sequence is about 1/3 of the fraction of positively 
	charged amino acids in the whole sequence. The fraction of negatively 
	charged amino acids in the disordered sequence is about twice as large
	as the fraction of negatively charged amino acids in the whole sequence.

	Disordered Sequence Ranges:
	 - % positively charged amino acids: 3% - 12%
	 - % negatively charged amino acids: 12% - 43%

	Complete Sequence Ranges:
	 - % positively charged amino acids: 14% - 21%
	 - % negatively charged amino acids: 18% - 21%


(2) How consistent is this property across the 268 Hsp90 orthologs?

	Very consistent; it is seen in almost every ortholog.
